This repository implements a Market Risk Intelligence & Regime Detection System using real NIFTY 50 index data. The project is designed to replicate institutional-style quantitative risk analysis workflows, focusing on return dynamics, volatility behavior, drawdowns, and regime identification.

The system is built using clean, modular Python code with reproducible data pipelines and version-controlled development, making it suitable for academic evaluation, quantitative finance interviews, and real-world risk analytics use cases.
